## Data Description

The data was adapted from Kirov and Cotteral (2019) https://github.com/ckirov/RevisitPinkerAndPrince/blob/master/experiment_1/english_merged.txt.

We cleaned the data by using the IPA for each verb and checking each verb's past tense on Merriam Webster Dictionary: https://www.merriam-webster.com/.
The cleaned up data is in 4039_ALL.csv, which contains all the verbs and its IPA transcripts. In this sheet, the verbs that have more than one past tense were put in the end of the sheet staring with 9- for the index.  

**Training** folder contains the four training datasets used in the paper. **Test** folder contains the real English verbs (Test.csv) and nonce verbs (Nonce.csv) used in the paper.
